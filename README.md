# coffee-shop-ordering-system
A C-language based project coded in Visual Studio. 
This project was compeleted in April 2019. 

Problem Statement:

Tired of the poor coffee options available on campus, the Kelley School of Business is opening a new espresso bar dedicated to students, faculty, and visitors named Espresso a Mano. Your team has been asked to develop an application to be used by the staff (i.e., the user) to manage the espresso bar. The application should allow users to process typical use cases for these establishments, such as selling espresso drinks (i.e., cappuccinos), and managing the price and quantity of the products and services sold. This document provides high-level requirements for your application. However, keep in mind that these requirements should be viewed as a minimum-viable-product and your team is encouraged to expand and customize the application.
