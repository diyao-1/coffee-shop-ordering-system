# coffee-shop-ordering-system
A C-language based project coded in Visual Studio. 
This project was compeleted in April 2019. 

Problem Statement:

Tired of the poor coffee options available on campus, the Kelley School of Business is opening a new espresso bar dedicated to students, faculty, and visitors named Espresso a Mano. 

1. Refer to "Updated UML.pdf" to see the design blueprint 
2. Developed an application to be used by the staff (i.e., the user) to manage the espresso bar. 
The application would allow users to process typical use cases for these establishments, such as selling espresso drinks (i.e., cappuccinos), and managing the price and inventories of products and services sold.
